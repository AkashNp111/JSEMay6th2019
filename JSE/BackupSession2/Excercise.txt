Excercise :

1. Sum of all natural numbers 
	input n = 3
	output = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

2. Sum of all even numbers 
	input n = 3
	output = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12

3. Sum of all Odd numbers 
	input n = 3
	output = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

4. Print a muliplication table

5. Count number of digits in the number

	input n = 123;
	output = 3;

6. Calculate Product Of Digits

	input n = 123;
	output = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6;


7. Swap two numbers

	input a = 10 ; b = 15;
	out put a = 15 ; b = 10;

8. Find all factors of given number

		input 6
		output 1,2,3



9. Write a program for given number is perfect number.

For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number.
